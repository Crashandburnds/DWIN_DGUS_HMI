In my github satspares/DWIN_DGUS_HMI in the utilities directory is this file test-serial.txt which has a link for the hive image.
For a test...

copy the hive.img.xz to a usb stick larger than 8GB with balenaEtcher 1.18 windows or linux.
boot from it..
modules should load on boot.

check the serial port name and speed in the script first!
/home/user/linux-test-serial.sh
if using 9600 this 'sleep 0.3s' may need to be larger in the script.

should give something like this..

115200
00000000: 83 00 0f 01 43 22 03 82 4f 4b 5a a5 06 83 10 00  ....C"..OKZ.....
00000010: 01 55 aa                                         .U.

uname -r this...
5.15.0-hiveos

lsmod | grep xr this..
xr_usb_serial_common 49152

If the does not work we need to do something else!
